                Hello, my name is Ethan Melton and I am a Mathematical 
                Sciences Major with an Emphasis in Mathematics. I am also
                minoring in Computer Science. I enjoy the outdoors and 
                often find myself taking walks among nature as well as 
                participating in sports in and outdoors. I also enjoy 
                playing all sorts of games not limited to: board games, 
                card games, video games, and table top rpgs. I enjoy
                all forms of art and like making 3D sculptures every
                now and then.
                
                I think Web Design is a useful skill to have because 
                the world is growing in technological prowess every day,
                so we should as well. Knowing how to make your own
                website can be very useful if you decide to create your
                own business one day, or even if you just have your own
                community group you want to have a website for.
